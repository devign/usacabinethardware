        <b><u>DATA PRIVACY</u></b><br>
        The data we collect during the order process is only used by us internally to process your order and maintain correspondence with you regarding that order.  The only entity that any of your data is shared with is Authorize.Net., however, that is only for the processing of your credit card.  Your personal data is never sold, rented or shared with any other third party.<br><br>
        <b><u>DATA SECURITY</u></b><br>
Ordering from our site is just as (or more) secure as ordering over the telephone or through the mail.  We use the latest in 256 bit SSL data encryption technology to secure the connection between your web browser and our state-of-the-art order processing system.  The secure connection continues from our system to Authorize.Net for credit card processing.  Every connection, every step of the way is secured.  Additionally, our system is continously monitered for possible security holes as new vulnerabilities arise, giving us the advantage of staying one-step ahead of possible intruders by maintaining tight system security. <br><br>
    <b><u>COOKIES</u></b><br> 
        Cookies are harmless little data files
    that are used to "remember" users when they return to a site.  As is the 
    case with most shopping sites, this site
    uses a cookie to keep track of your session id and shopping cart.  
    However, once
    you close your web browser, the cookie is deleted, nothing is stored on
    your computer.  If you have your browser set to deny cookies, you still
    may be able to order as our system also uses the IP address to save 
    your cart information (this only works if you are not being fed from a              
    proxy/cache server, such as <b>AOL</b> uses, in which case you 
    <b>must</b> allow the cookie from our site to be able to proceed with an 
    order).<br><br>

        <u><b>PRODUCT AVAILABILITY</b></u><br>
        Most of the products on our site are in stock and ready to ship the same day 
        if your order is placed before 2:00pm Central Time.  Those items that are
        thinly stocked or not stocked at all, are identified on their respective
        item detail page.<br><br>

		A $5 small order
        processing fee is added to the shipping on orders less than $25.00.  We must
        charge this fee to offset some of the charges incurred from our fulfillment
        distributors. 
        <br><br>
		        
        <u><b>SHIPPING WITHIN 48 CONTINENTAL U.S.A.</b></u><br>
        For orders shipped within the continental United States, your shipping cost 
        is calculated from shipping rate charts, using the total weight of your 
        order and the shipping method you have chosen. You may choose from  
        Ground, 3Day Ground, 2nd Day Air or Nextday Air and your order will be
        shipped either by UPS or FedEx via the method you specify. <!--You can also have 
        the shipping calculated before you enter the order placement process by 
        entering your zip code into the
        <b>Shipping Calculator</b> located on the <b>Show Cart</b> screen.--><br><br>
        			      <br />
      <br />
        We offer FREE standard ground shipping to the 48 contintental United States
        on orders over $77 and are less than 25 pounds total shipping weight. Orders
		that are more than 25 pounds but over $100 will receive discounted shipping. 
        Any orders that are split into several smaller orders in an attempt to reduce the
		weight and circumvent the system to qualify for free shipping on
		all of the split orders will be combined into 1 order by
		our staff.
		<br><br>
        <u><b>SHIPPING OUTSIDE 48 CONTINENTAL U.S.A.</b></u><br>
        We can also ship to Hawaii, Alaska and Canada (sorry, we currently do not offer any
        other international shipping).  You may select from either 2ND Day Air or Next Day
    Air service for Hawaii and Alaska.  All Canadian orders are shipped via USPS.<br><br>

        We do not offer free samples, discounted samples, free shipping on samples 
        or any other special treatment of sample orders.  Samples are still products 
        that cost money to purchase and ship.  We simply cannot meet our goal of 
        extending the lowest possible prices to all of our customers while sending 
        out samples in any other way than like a regular order. Our sample program 
        is the most simple, logical and economical for both of us.<br><br>
        You can order as many sample pieces as you'd like, we won't tell you 
        how many you can order.  If
        you want to return any sample pieces you will need to follow the return
        procedure above.  However, if after viewing the samples you place a full 
		order, we will waive the restocking fees for the returned samples.

Due to the variances in computer monitors and the various settings to brightness and contrast that users may adjust their monitors to, we cannot guarantee with any certainty that the color represented in a product image on your monitor is exactly as it appears in the physical world. This mainly applies to the decorative cabinet hardware, as these come in several different finishes. If you will be ordering a large quantity of an item and it is imperative that the finish/color is exactly like the image on the site, please order a sample to examine ahead of time.
