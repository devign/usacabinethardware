        <p><b>1) How do I order samples?</b><br>
        Samples are ordered just like any other item on our site, simply add any
        item you want to sample to your shopping cart and proceed to checkout.  For
        more information, see our <a href="policies.html#samples">policies</a> page.
        </p>
        <a name="2"></a>
        <p><b>2) Will I get charged a restocking fee when I return the 
        samples?</b><br>
        You may or may not get charged a restocking fee.  Please see our 
        <a href="policies.html#samples">policy</a> on samples.
        </p>
        </p>

        <p><b>3) I don't want to give my credit card 
        information over the web, how else can I order?</b><br>
        No problem, you can order by fax or mail.  When you click on CHECKOUT, the 
        first page
        of the checkout process will ask you whether you want to place a secure
        online order or if you want to order by fax or mail.  By selecting FAX/MAIL,
        <b>none</b> of your credit card information is sent over the Internet. 
        A printable order form will be created with your name, address and items
        already on it.  After printing the page then you write your credit card
        info on it and send it to us.
        </p>    
        <a name="4"></a>        
        <p><b>4) I want to order but don't see Alaska   
        [Hawaii] listed, do you ship to Alaska [Hawaii]?</b><br>
        Yes, we will ship to Alaska or Hawaii, however, the order method is 
        different.  We must get a shipping price for you before you can place the
        order.  For more information on our shipping policy and how to order if
        you are from Alaska or Hawaii, please visit our 
        <a href="policies.html#sh">policies</a> page.
        </p>    
        <a name="5"></a>        
        <p><b>5) Can I return an item if it doesn't fit?</b><br>
        Yes, you may return items that don't fit or that you don't like within 30
        days after you receive them.  Special order items are <b>non-returnable</b>!
        Please visit our 
        <a href="policies.html#returns">policies</a> page for more information.
        </p>    
        <a name="6"></a>        
        <p><b>6) Can you give me a quote on XXXXXX with shipping to XX?</b><br>
        <b>If the item is listed in our online catalog...</b><br>
        simply add the quantity
        to your cart, any discounts for that item will be calculated in the cart.  
        To see how much shipping is going to be, enter your zip code into the input
        box under SHIPPING CALCULATOR and click the CALCULATE button.  Shipping
        will be calculated for all shipping options available.<br><br>
        
        <b>If the item is not listed in our online catalog...</b><br>
        Please email us the product number, quantity and shipping zip code and we
        will be happy to send you a quote.
        </p>    
        <a name="7"></a>        
        <p><b>7) Can you tell me who carries your products in the XXXXXX        
        area?</b><br>
        We are not the manufacturer, importer or distributor for any of the products
        on our site and therefore do not have a dealer network to search for you. 
        Some of the manufacturers have dealer locators on their sites or at least
        have some form of contact information listed so you can contact them about
        such things.
        </p>    
        <a name="8"></a>        
        <p><b>8) I'm not sure if my order went through, did you get my 
        order?</b><br>
        After you click the final "SUBMIT ORDER" button, two things should happen 
        with a successful order placement:<br>
        <ol>
        <li>An order confirmation screen containing an order number should be 
        displayed in your web browser.</li>
        <li>If you typed in your email address correctly, you should receive an
        email receipt within minutes.</li>
        </ol>
        If neither of these happened, then your order did not get placed.  If you
        encountered an error or difficulty during the checkout process, please send
        an email to <a href="mailto:webadmin@usacabinethardware.com?Subject=ORDER%20DIFFICULTY">web services</a> for investigation.
        </p>            
        <a name="9"></a>        
        <p><b>9) Can you send me\Do you have a catalog?</b><br>
        Printed catalogs are costly to not only produce, but also to maintain.  We
        like to think of ourselves as a progressive company, using technology to 
        keep our operating expenses low and customer satisfaction high.  For this
        reason we do not publish a printed catalog, rather, we have an extensive
        searchable electronic catalog available 24/7 right here on our site!  
        </p>    
        <a name="10"></a>       
        <p><b>10) What is a registered customer?</b><br>
        By registering with a username and password when you place your first order,
        you can simply login with them when you place subsequent orders.  Your 
        information is retrieved from our database, saving you the work of typing
        it in again.  Also, you can use your username and password to login and
        view your account history, change your information, etc.  In no way does
        registering mean that you waive your privacy rights nor does it change
        our <a href="policies.html#privacy">privacy policy</a> in regards to how
        your information is used.
